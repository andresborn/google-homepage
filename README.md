# I am going to replicate the Google Homepage using HTML and CSS

# I learned to use Flexbox and Grid a lot better but I think my code is very unorganized. I should've done a whole grid for the entire page and then smaller grids and flexboxes inside. I kinda winged it with this one but it worked out. Next project will be better planned.
